# Get started using Hugging Face:

1. Create an Account at [https://huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co).
   
2. Explore the Model Hub [https://huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models) to discover pre-trained models.

3. Install the required libraries. For example:
     ```bash
     pip install transformers
     ```
4. Find models at  [https://huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models)

5. Use a Pre-trained Model. For example, to generate text with GPT-J 6B:
     ```python
     from transformers import pipeline

     # Create a text generation pipeline with a pre-trained model
     generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B')
     
     # Generate text based on a prompt
     prompt = "How big is Greenland?"
     results = generator(prompt, max_length=50)
     
     # Print the generated text
     print(results[0]['generated_text'])
     ```
By following these steps, you can quickly begin using Hugging Faceâ€™s powerful tools to build and deploy machine learning models in your projects. For more detailed guides and advanced usage, check out the [official Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs).
